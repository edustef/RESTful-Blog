# RESTful-Blog

## Description

This site was made for the purpose of learning the **REST** conventions and how to manage routes, post, delete, update, etc.

It is a very simple looking site build with **Semantic-UI**. The backend was done in **NodeJS** using **Express** and **MongoDB** for storing the data.

## Requirements to run the site on a local server

If you want to run this on a local server:

1. You need **nodejs** and **mongoDB server**
2. Install all the required packages using `npm install` *(Make sure you're in the root folder of the project before running the command)*.
3. Install nodemon as global using  `npm install nodemon -g`
4. In the command line run `npm start` or `npm run index.js` to run without nodemon.

Default port is 5000
